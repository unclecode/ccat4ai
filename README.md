## Why CodeCat4AI?

I noticed people keep looking for tools to convert a repo into one file to attach to their favorite LLM. Finding no simple solution, I created this 5-line bash script to do the job efficiently!

## Features

- **Fast**: Quickly processes repositories of any size
- **Simple**: Just a 5-line bash script - no complex dependencies
- **Flexible**: Works with both remote and local repositories
- **Smart**: Automatically detects text files
- **Dual Output**: Generates both full and compact versions
- **Clean**: Handles temporary files and cleanup automatically

## Installation

### Using Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
# Install from Homebrew
brew tap unclecode/ccode
brew install ccat4ai
```

This will install the tool as `ccat4ai`. After installation, you'll see instructions on how to create a symlink to use `ccat` as a shorter command if you prefer.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unclecode/ccat4ai.git

# Run the installer
cd ccat4ai
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer automatically:
- Makes the script executable
- Installs it to your PATH (either `/usr/local/bin` or `~/.local/bin`)
- Adds PATH entries to your shell config if needed

## Uninstallation

```bash
# If you cloned the repository
cd ccat4ai
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh

# Or run the uninstaller directly
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unclecode/ccat4ai/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - output defaults to "codebase"
ccat [repository_url_or_path] [output_name]
```

The second parameter `[output_name]` is optional and defaults to `codebase` if not provided.

### Examples

```bash
# Process a remote repository with custom output name
ccat4ai https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai crawl4ai

# Process a remote repository with default output name
# Creates codebase.md and mini.codebase.md
ccat4ai https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai

# Process a local repository by name (if in current directory)
ccat4ai crawl4ai

# Process a local repository by path
ccat4ai ~/projects/crawl4ai

# If you created the ccat symlink:
ccat https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai
```

### Output

The tool generates two files:
- `[output_name].md` - Full version with all text files concatenated
- `mini.[output_name].md` - Compact version with only function/class definitions

Both files include a directory tree structure at the end.

## Local vs Remote Repositories

- If a URL is provided (starts with http://, https://, or git@), the tool clones the repository temporarily
- If just a name is provided (like "crawl4ai"), the tool assumes it's a local directory in the current path
- If a path is provided, the tool uses that local repository
